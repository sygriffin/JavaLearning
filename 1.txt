China has confirmed that a second Canadian citizen has been detained since Canada's arrest of a Chinese business official earlier this month.

Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang spoke to reporters in Beijing Thursday about the situation. Lu said that businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig had been detained on Monday. Kovrig had been reported as missing earlier this week. Reports of Spavor's disappearance began to show up on Wednesday.

Lu said the two Canadians' are suspected of acts that harm state security and that their legal rights were being "safeguarded."

He said Beijing security and state security officials in the city of Dandong, Liaoning Province had taken measures against Spavor and Kovrig.
